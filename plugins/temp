=head1 NAME

temp - Plugin to monitor temperature and dewpoint from a TEMPerHUM USB sensor

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The following environment variables are used by this plugin:

=over 4

=item temp_warning <float>

Threshold for when to report a warning

=item temp_critical <float>

Threshold for when to report a critical

=back

=head2 EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION

 [temp]
  env.temp_warning 5
  env.temp_critical 10

=head1 NOTES

If run with the "autoconf"-parameter, give our opinion on whether we
should be run on this system or not. This is optional, and only used
by munin-config. In the case of this plugin, we should most probably
always be included.
